                In an effort to support creative, productive, desired changes in the experience of those in a learning environment, RelationaLearning™ was created. If a person has the skills to navigate the relational elements of the learning experience, he or she can carry those skills from classroom to classroom, to non-traditional learning environments, to work, and to the larger community.

          <h2>What is the strategy to make relationshipsthe context for teaching and learning?</h2>
          <p>Getting people to recognize the wisdom of their own experience is the basis for building their capacity for inter-relating effectively in learning environments of all kinds. The method for building that capacity is rooted in the relational approach, in the context of the learning moment, in restoring a balance of instructing and educating.
The RelationaLearning™ model outlined below suggests that all learning progresses through four levels of relationship. We are always in a relationship but the quality of that relationship and therefore the quality of learning varies greatly. As we move through each level, we can identify the added power that relationships can bring to our learning.</p>

            <p>The best thing for disturbances of the spirit is to learn. That is the only thing that never fails. That is the only thing which the poor mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting. —T.H. White</p>
